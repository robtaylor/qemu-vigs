Samsung Platform emulator
=========================

A mobile phone emulator for S5PC110 based handsets, based on QEMU 0.10.5
The emulator includes both an x86 and ARM version, and an inbuilt NFS server for hosting NFS root.


Building
========

Install Ubuntu packages as follows:

aptitude install bison flex autoconf gcc libglu1-mesa-dev libsdl1.2-dev libgtk2.0-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev debhelper libxml2-dev libasound2-dev libx11-dev zlib1g-dev

then:

./build.sh


Running
=======

The code has some dependencies on Scratchbox 1.0, which need cleaning up...
Currently, it expects a /scratchbox directory, with an x86 or ARM target configured, and a Linux kernel + initrd.
Alternately, you can boot an image.  See the configuration dialog when first starting up.
